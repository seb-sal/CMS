**My project is developed 100% in:**

* _Ruby on Rails and,_

* _Bootstrap_


**Project description:**

_"Create a basic Customer Management System for Small Business Owners to help them 'store' their customer information in a single place, and accessible nby anyone in the company"._


**Current problem this project addresses:**

_Many small business ownwers keep their client information in a single excel spreadsheet, stored in a local server, instead of having a customer management system because some web app alternatives are too expensive for them to have._ 

_Not having a CRM in place might create the following problems, those which this project will also address:_

* Multiple copies of the file throughout the company (not knowing which one is the latest one).
* Out-dated client/product information.
* Fear of uploading the incorrect version to the server.
* Fear of overwriting the 'latest-greatest copy onto the server.
* Unable to trace or track updates.
* Spend un-necessary time on tedious, no-brainer tasks on db mining.




**Marginal Vaiable Product (MVP):**

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'see'** all my clients in one single page.

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'create'** my client information on the web, therefore I should click a 'create new client' button.

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'save'** the information of my client I just added, therefpre I should click a 'save' button to save their information.

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'update'** my client's information, therefore, I should click a 'update' button to update their information.

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'delete'** the clients I no longer work with, therefore I should click a 'delete' button to permanently delete them.

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'sign up'** to the CRM, so I should be able to click the 'sign up' to sign-in

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'login'** to the CRM, so I should be able to type in my credentials to login.

[] As an admin user, I'd like to **'logout'** the CRM after I finish using it.

[] As an admin user, it'll be nice to see a **'Welcome' message**

[] As an admin user, it'll be nice to **see my name** after the greet me message

[] As and admin user, it'll be nice to see the options on a **top nav bar**


**Icebox**

[] It would be nice to display a profile picture for each admin user.

[] It would be nice to **add a purchase option** on the top nav bar.
